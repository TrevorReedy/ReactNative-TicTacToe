            Hi! <br></br>
            My name is Jaileia Yang and I am majoring in Computer Information Technology.
            This is my last semester here at Metropolitan State University and I will be graduating
            this Spring. I am happy to have been a part of this group as it has taught me so much
            about React Native. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy UX design!

          Hi there! <br></br>
          I'm Nick Kelley, currently a junior at Metro State majoring in Computer Science.
          I like working on computers because it is difficult and challenging, plus its a skill that
          most people don't have. This class was my first glimpse into mobile development and
          I found it very engaging!

            Sometime, bugs spawn in least likely to be noticed in development process that 
            eventually cause your hairloss go faster. I like to play video games in my free time
             to escape reality and potential hairloss. üòÅ

        Hello! {"\u263A"} <br></br>
        Hello, my name is Trevor, and I am currently a junior at Metropolitan State 
        University with a strong passion for software development. I am particularly drawn 
        to working with real-world data and leveraging my skills to manipulate and analyze it 
        in ways that provide value to users. I find it incredibly rewarding to transform complex, 
        often chaotic data into meaningful insights and solutions.
