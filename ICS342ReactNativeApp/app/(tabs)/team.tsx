            Hi! <br></br>
            My name is Jaileia Yang and I am majoring in Computer Information Technology.
            This is my last semester here at Metropolitan State University and I will be graduating
            this Spring. I am happy to have been a part of this group as it has taught me so much
            about React Native. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy UX design!

            Hey there! <br></br>
            I'm Natalia Johnson, majoring in Computer Information Technology, I'll be graduating at the end
            of this semester. This class has been pretty disconnected from most of the others I've taken,
            until this class I never has given much thought to app development. This class has been very informative
            and I'm glad I decided to take it!

          Hi there! <br></br>
          I'm Nick Kelley, currently a junior at Metro State majoring in Computer Science.
          I like working on computers because it is difficult and challenging, plus its a skill that
          most people don't have. This class was my first glimpse into mobile development and
          I found it very engaging!

            Hello, I am Noah Willgohs <br></br>
            I am a senior here at Metropolitan State University majoring in Computer Science.
            This is my last semester here as I will be graduating after it. This was an interesting
            and, at least for me, somewhat difficult class, as I had a good amount of difficulty understanding
            Android architecture. It was neat to learn a little bit more about the innerworkings of React.

            Sometime, bugs spawn in least likely to be noticed in development process that 
            eventually cause your hairloss go faster. I like to play video games in my free time

        Hello! {"\u263A"} <br></br>
        Hello, my name is Trevor, and I am currently a junior at Metropolitan State 
        University with a strong passion for software development. I am particularly drawn 
        to working with real-world data and leveraging my skills to manipulate and analyze it 
        in ways that provide value to users. I find it incredibly rewarding to transform complex, 
        often chaotic data into meaningful insights and solutions.
